# emergence ideas

## Desired goals

### Minimal

emergence itself should be minimal, and be extended with Addons.

## Language choice

### Nodes

Probably going to be using Clojure for emergence.

This will include the `nodes` from the P2P network implemented, and
backed by CouchDB and Clojure.

Wait- why use CoychDB? RDBMS would work fine as well, no?

### GUI

Using Clojure for the desktop GUI.

It is possible with the provided REST API for one to make a third
party client for emergence.
